/* 
Note: This is a placeholder comment.

In a real implementation, you would include the full bootstrap.min.css content here,
but since it's a large file (>200KB), I'm just creating a placeholder.

For the actual implementation, you should:
1. Download bootstrap.min.css from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
2. Place it in your project's static/css/ directory

/* Alternatively, use the CDN version as included in the base.html template:
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
