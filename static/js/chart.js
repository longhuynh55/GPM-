/* 
Note: This is a placeholder comment.

In a real implementation, you would include the full chart.js content here,
but since it's a large file (>200KB), I'm just creating a placeholder.

For the actual implementation, you should:
1. Download chart.js from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js
2. Place it in your project's static/js/ directory

/* Alternatively, use the CDN version as included in the base.html template:
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
